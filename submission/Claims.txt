Files:
==========
*All the files I submitted, asm.cpp and claims.txt, have my name and student id at the start, along with a declaration of authorship.

The evidence for Assembler including the output files from the X (eg five)  test examples has also been uploaded. They are test1(3 output files), test2(3 output files), test3
(1 output file). All the test files have been tested and work properly. 

*My cpp program did not show any errors and warnings when i compiled it with
g++ asm.cpp

*Program is compilable with g++ asm.c -o asm

=============================
Program format and structure:
=============================
1. The assembler:

    * with two data structures to store respectively labels and mnemonic table with expected operands.
    * uses a single routine for both passes.
    * detects label erros.
    * consistent and sensible formatting with sensible program structure. 
    * sensible variable, function & type names with explanatory comments.
		* advanced listing file.
		* assembles test programs.
	  * can implements and demonstrates the instruction SET.

=============================
Testing:
=============================

1. The assembler:

I have tested  X/ five examples shown as bellow. The errors only occurred in the file test2.asm and 
the program immediately stopped on the second pass. 

The others were tested without any errors detected and produced three output files, listing file, 
error log file and machine readable object file, for each example. 
 

1)
#Input: asm test1.asm
#Output: 
a. test1.l 
b. test1.log (without any error messages)
c. test1.o

2)
#Input:asm test2.asm
#Output: 
a. test2.l 
b. test2.log (error messages shown as below in log file and terminal)
c. test2.o

error messages:
ERROR: Duplicate Label at line 4
WARNING: Incorrect label format at line 10
ERROR: Unknown Symbol as operand at line 5
ERROR: Unknown Symbol as operand at line 6
ERROR: Operand expected at line 7
ERROR: Operand not expected at line 8
ERROR: Unknown Symbol as operand at line 9
ERROR: Mnemonic not defined at line 11
ERROR: Mnemonic not defined at line 12

3)
#Input:./asm test3.asm
#Output: 
a. test3.l 
b. test3.log (without any error messages)
c. test3.o

4)
#Input:./asm test4.asm
#Output: 
a. test4.l 
b. test4.log (without any error messages)
c. test4.o

4)
#Input:./asm test4.asm
#Output: 
a. test4.l 
b. test4.log (without any error messages)
c. test4.o

5) 
#Input:./asm MyBubbleSort.asm
#Output: 
a. MyBubbleSort.l 
b. MyBubbleSort.log (without any error messages)
c. MyBubbleSort.o
